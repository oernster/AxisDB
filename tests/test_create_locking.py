"""`AxisDB.create(..., overwrite=True)` must not touch a database another writer holds.

`create` takes the exclusive writer lock before it writes the new file, so a
refused overwrite raises `LockError` and leaves the existing data in place.
The first test holds the writer in this process; the second holds it in a
real child process, as `test_locking_multiprocess.py` does.
